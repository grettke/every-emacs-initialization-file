* Justification For Existence Of This Project

Share links to Emacs initialization files with minimal effort!

I love reading all kinds of Emacs configuration files ranging for super
refined to just starting out. For example [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][caisah]] has a list of loads of
stellar examples. However the only way to get added to that list is for your
configuration to be notable. That is a pretty high bar for people just
starting out. New people also usually have the freshest ideas though and they
challenge the status quo of what we currently consider "the best". All of
those perspectives are valuable so I wanted to create a simple list that can
include all of them.

The only requirement for adding a link here is that you or someone else values
it. A lot or a little no matter how muchâ€”someone just needs to have found it
valuable. No shyness or self-consciousness allowed: absolutely add your own! ðŸ˜„

Emacs is about sharing and learning and that includes the entire spectrum of
code out there. Happy Hacking!

* How To Contribute

- Steps
  - Identify Emacs initialization files that either you or someone else found
    valuable in some way no matter how large or small.
  - Find a link where to get the configuration. That would be a link to the
    Git project containing it, the file itself, or a blog post. It is at your
    discretion.
  - Add that link here.

* Keep It Simple

The links are stored as headlinesâ€”that way you can store as little or as much
information as you like in whatever way that you want. Add notes, comments,
attribution, and any other classifications of anything. You can apply Org
tags, properties, etc. here. Utilize everything that Org has to offer. Think
of their headline as the most important note to leave for the future reader,
and that includes unforeseen ways that they might want to /use/ the metadata
too!

HELP is the culmination of everything that I've learned about literate
programming (LP) in Org-Modeâ€”written with the intent to share it with others
in total and complete respect and consideration of you and the value of your
time. No platitude here: time /is/ precious.

With that in mind here is a breakdown of the sections you might be interested
in (and should ignore):

Here are the files that compose HELP in order of load dependency, the next one
always load the previous one. The first two configuration files are the most
reusable "out of box" parts of HELP:

- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Org-Mode_Exemple_Complet_Minimal.org][Org-Mode Exemple Complet Minimal]] \rarr [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grettke/help/master/.org-mode-ecm.emacs.el][.org-mode-ecm.emacs.el]]
  - Proper etiquette before posting questions to the mailing list is to start
    Org with nothing else loaded to debug your issueâ€”this is that
    configuration. It helps you create the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#ecm][Org ECM: Exemple Complet Minimal]]
  - Helper function to dump all of the information you need to include in the ECM
  - By necessity all of the *essential* Emacs configuration, though not much, is
    in there too and definitely worth taking a look at
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Org-Mode_Fundamentals.org][Org-Mode Fundamentals]] \rarr [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/.org-mode-fundamentals.emacs.el][.org-mode-fundamentals.emacs.el]]
  - Org-Mode configuration great for the style of LP described by the table [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Org-Mode_Fundamentals.org#literate-programming][here]]
  - Individual headlines are good for reference and copy and paste too
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Package-Management.org][Package-Management.org]] \rarr [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/.org-mode-package-management.emacs.el][.org-mode-package-management.emacs.el]]
  - Package management configuration stuff
  - Safe to ignore
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Contribute.org][Contribute.org]] \rarr [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/.org-mode-contribute.emacs.el][.org-mode-contribute.emacs.el]]
  - Loads packages that for some reason I make changes
  - Safe to ignore
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/help.org][help.org]] \rarr [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grettke/help/master/.emacs.el][.emacs.el]]
  - /The/ section to skim and find parts to copy and paste
    - All of my very personal preferences.
  - Intent driven headlines that are personal favorites and maybe useful to you
    - [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/help.org#style-guide][LP Style Guide]]
      - Writing style guard-rails
    - [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/help.org#history][History]]
      - Most of the time you see initialization files that are the result of
        years of continuous refinement and improvementâ€”you never see the
        complete messes! The fun story about my config include the mistakes,
        confusion, and completely dropping Emacs! It is really fond memories
        for me, too.

This setup includes multiple files from the .emacs and is designed to just work for many versions of Emacs (v23 to current).
